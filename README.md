# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Overview
This project is a simple E-Library Management System built with React. It allows users to add, view, edit, borrow, and return books, providing a user-friendly interface to manage a collection of books effectively. The data is stored in the browser's local storage, making it persistent across sessions.

Features
Add Books: Users can fill out a form to add new books to the library with details like title, genre, author, and an image.
View Books: Users can see a list of all books in the library. Each entry displays relevant details and allows for editing or deletion.
Edit Books: Users can modify the details of an existing book.
Borrow/Return Functionality: Users can simulate borrowing and returning books, with notifications displayed for actions taken.
Search and Filter: Users can search for books by any field and sort the displayed list.
Technologies Used
React: The core library for building the user interface.
React Router: For navigating between different components (pages).
Toastify: For displaying notifications to the user.
CSS: For styling the components.
